                    Brasília was planned and built in a remarkably short period, primarily between 1956 and 1960. 
                    The idea of creating a new capital in the interior of Brazil was proposed as early as the late 19th century, 
                    but it wasn't until the mid-20th century that serious efforts were made. 
                    President Juscelino Kubitschek, elected in 1956, made the construction of Brasília one of his main goals, 
                    promoting it as a symbol of Brazil's modernization and progress.

                        Throught history, Brazil has had three capitals, 
                        and despite the fact that Brasilia is the current capital for the last 64 years,
                        many people outside the country still think is Rio de Janeiro, or Sao Paulo the most known Brazil city.

                    The city was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and the urban planner Lúcio Costa. 
                    Niemeyer's modernist architecture and Costa's urban planning principles resulted in a city with a distinctive layout resembling an airplane or bird in flight 
                    when viewed from above. The city is divided into numbered blocks, 
                    with designated areas for specific functions such as residential, commercial, and governmental.

                    Brasília was inaugurated as the capital of Brazil on April 21, 1960. 
                    The inauguration ceremony was attended by President Kubitschek, along with other dignitaries. 
                    The city was officially opened to the public, and government offices began to relocate from Rio de Janeiro, the previous capital.

                        Brasilia's first citizens were mainly composed of construction workers,
                        that migrated from various parts of Brazil, especially the northeast region, 
                        they are referred to as "candangos" and that is a city named after them near Brasilia.

                        Despite being the capital and a cultural hub, there are not that many outside attractions or concerts.
                        In that regard Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are better.
